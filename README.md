# Modern Data Warehouse with Microsoft SQL Server

This repository contains the implementation of a clean, modern data warehouse solution built using Microsoft SQL Server. The project covers the full lifecycle of data warehousing from requirements gathering to modeling and analytics, leveraging best practices and structured ETL layers (Bronze, Silver, Gold).

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a robust and scalable data warehousing approach tailored for analytical workloads. It includes:

- Requirement definition and documentation
- Data architecture design
- Structured ETL pipeline development (Bronze → Silver → Gold)
- Data modeling and optimization
- Analytical querying and visualization readiness

## 🧭 Project Phases

### 1. Define Requirements
This phase involves gathering business and technical requirements by consulting with stakeholders. Key deliverables include:

- Business goals and KPIs
- Source systems and data scope
- Data quality and refresh expectations
- Compliance and security needs

### 2. Design Data Architecture
Design a scalable and maintainable architecture using:

- Microsoft SQL Server (Database Engine)
- Logical and physical schema design
- Star/snowflake schema modeling
- Data flow diagrams
- ETL orchestration plan

### 3. Project Initialization
Setting up the foundational components of the project:

- SQL Server instance and databases
- Source-to-target mappings
- Folder structure for scripts (ETL, DDL, DML, etc.)
- Git version control initialization

### 4. Build Layered ETL Pipeline

#### 🔹 Bronze Layer – Raw Staging
- Ingest raw data from source systems (CSV, APIs, databases)
- Apply minimal transformations (data type casting, timestamping)
- Track source lineage and load metadata

#### 🔸 Silver Layer – Cleaned and Conformed
- Data cleansing and deduplication
- Standardize formats and structure
- Join and integrate data from multiple sources

#### 🟡 Gold Layer – Analytical Models
- Star-schema based fact and dimension tables
- Aggregated and business-friendly views
- Optimized for Power BI / SSRS / Excel reporting
